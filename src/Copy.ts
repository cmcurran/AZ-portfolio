          `The purpose of this artistic research project is to formulate a conceptual framework for creative and exhibitionary practices aimed towards degrowth, while simultaneously composing a toolbox for artists, curators, as well as institutions, aimed towards designing ethical and sustainable creative practices during the pandemic and beyond. The approach delineated within this toolbox is two-pronged: first, offering a set of considerations and questions for artworkers to use when designing a project; and second, proposing specific, concrete and practical actions art workers may take towards ethical and sustainable creative and exhibitionary practices.`,

          `Degrowth is a term that is often perceived as negative or even off-putting, as it is conflated with “recession” or “decline”.[1] On the contrary, degrowth refers to a conscious, collective, intentional commitment to significantly reducing production and consumption, to finding alternatives to our current organisational models (be they economic or otherwise) and to proactively transform society. In these respects, degrowth is fundamentally an anticapitalist and decolonial endeavour, as it is diametrically opposed to capitalist-colonial ideas of infinite growth and expansion, of perpetual exploitation, while centering the voices and well-being of those currently in the margins of white Western capitalist cisheteropatriarchy, be they human or non-human. Additionally, degrowth is often informed by ecofeminism, and is concerned with the politics and ethics of care.`,
          `What the pandemic and subsequent crisis has made abundantly clear is that degrowth is necessary – that our current ways of working and organising are unsustainable and inadequate in adapting to the oncoming changes brought by not only by the pandemic itself, but by climate change, civil unrest, and by the broader paradigm shift. As the chasm of social inequality grows wider and resources become scarcer, it has become vital for individual artists and curators as well as art institutions to reconsider their role in society: what do we offer, what are we taking, what are we facilitating? We art workers are faced with an opportunity to rethink and redesign our practices; degrowth presents a challenge to the status quo and offers a toolbox for transformative change.`,
          `What I will be expanding on in this research are practices and tools aimed towards long-term, community-initiated and community-organized projects in which the priority is to create lasting impact rather than, for instance, a short-term solution to a structural problem. This approach is substantially and qualitatively different from what is now known as socially-engaged practice, because it is developed within an alternative conceptual framework which includes, for example: the rejection of the capitalist work ethic and the endless production of projects in order to stay afloat and (hopefully) relevant; the rejection of arbitrary metrics of success (such as visitor numbers or Instagram likes); the rejection of spectacle over substance or use. The aforementioned go hand-in-hand with ecological considerations, requiring, for example, the elimination of unnecessary travel, something already in effect due to the pandemic. Hybrid exhibitionary practices are integral to degrowth and have been much talked about during the pandemic as well, but through a degrowth lens they are not limited to the often-seen binary model of digital/physical, instead expanding to include practices better integrated into the fabric of daily life and which do not require technological equipment of a certain quality in order to be accessible.`,
          `To summarise, I will be exploring specific and practical tools aimed at integrating degrowth politics into creative and exhibitionary practices while strongly emphasising the need to democratise and down-scale artistic production. `,
