      <p>
        The women depicted in the 20 drawings of <bold>Pulp</bold> are taken
        from lesbian-themed pulp fiction covers. In isolating the faces,
        attention is drawing to the way lesbian women are depicted in our
        culture; while the process of observing and replicating these depictions
        refers to the way societal stereotypes and perceptions are learned and
        perpetuated. With story-telling being a fundamentally human way of
        mapping and understanding the world, the lack of proper lesbian
        representation across all forms of media has left countless women
        feeling alienated from society and feeling an absence of cultural
        identity.
