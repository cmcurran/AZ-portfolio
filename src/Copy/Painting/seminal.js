      <p>
        This project explores my complex relationship with systems of
        communication, both linguistic and visual, as I attempt to find my space
        in a sociolinguistic environment which has branded me as <em>Other</em>{" "}
        being both female and homosexual, a “woman-identified woman”.
        Approximately 150 mixed media drawings were plastered on the walls of a
        small room, creating a highly charged space isolated from its
        surrounding environment. A makeshift table and chairs were placed in the
        centre of this room, allowing visitors a safe space to openly discuss
        issues of gender identity, sexuality, feminism, and patriarchal
        tradition in art and culture.
