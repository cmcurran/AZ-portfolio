        <i>If the LORD your God enlarges your territory</i> investigates the
        role archaeology plays in the construction of cultural heritage and
        political identity, challenging its viewers to consider the influence
        colonial and capitalist institutions play in the shaping of history,
        territory, and contemporary politics.

        Zaghi collected the ceramic fragments from the ground of Tepe Sialk, a
        large archaeological site outside the city of Kashan in the Isfahan
        Province of central Iran, during a research trip in 2001. The age of
        these glazed ceramic remains is unknown – the oldest settlements in the
        area date to 6000-5500 BC. They spent the most part of the next decade
        stored in a box in the care of the artist’s parents. When Zaghi first
        attempted to move the archaeological remains to Sweden, she was faced
        with strong resistance from her family who asserted that remains should
        not be taken from their country and place of origin. In January 2019,
        finally, Zaghi smuggled them to Sweden from Iran in her suitcase.

        Archaeology as a discipline is relatively recent, its origins
        inextricably tangled in the projects of colonialism and capitalism. The
        original excavations of Tepe Sialk itself, afterall, were conducted in
        the interest of Western capitalist and colonial power (in 1933, 1934 and
        1937), with most of the transportable artefacts now in the Louvre
        collection in Paris, and parts found in the British Museum in London and
        The Metropolitan Museum in New York. Archaeology as a discipline is,
        nonetheless, highly influential in shaping our current understanding of
        cultural heritages around the world, of national identities, and
        consequently informs the rhetoric of patriotic and nationalist movements
        across the globe.

        <i>If the LORD your God enlarges your territory</i> asks the viewers to
        consider: <em>Who has the right to decide what is heritage?</em> The
        title of the work is borrowed from a passage in the book of Deutoronomy,
        indicating the long history of the struggle for sovereignty over
        heritage and territory – and more recently we have witnessed the
        deliberate destruction of sites of cultural heritage by the Islamic
        State in Iraq, Syria, and Libya. The work asks:{" "}
        <em>
          Why do heritage and history have to be destroyed? What is history
          doing?
        </em>
      </p>

        The pottery fragments are symbols of the revision of history. Their
        theft, their illegal migration from Iran to Sweden, their display –
        their broken sharpness contrasted by the softness of the medical gauze –
        all these steps add up to a performative act that reveals the web of
        relationships between cultural heritage, national territories, citizens,
        and the ongoing reality of the capitalist colonial paradigm.
