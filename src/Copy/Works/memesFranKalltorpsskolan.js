        <i>Memes från Kålltorpsskolan</i> is a socially engaged pedagogical art
        project in which, through a series of meetings over January and February
        2018, the year 8 students of Kålltorpsskolan in Gothenburg expressed
        themselves through memes. The aim was to increase students' competence
        and confidence in expressing themselves with the help of images and
        text, while also making them aware of their power to make problematic
        social structures visible and to influence society through art.

        In facilitating an environment in which the children can speak freely,
        they were given the space to discuss complex issues such as human
        rights, feminism, gender equality, democracy, censorship, racism and
        more. During a study visit to the exhibition <i>Mozart's Ghost</i> at
        Göteborgs Konsthall, the students received an introduction to
        contemporary art and discussed the variety methods employed by
        contemporary works of art to communicate and disseminate global issues,
        and even affect political discourses. The students were challenged to
        further reflect and work on the questions:{" "}
        <em>
          What works well / not well at home? What works well / not well in my
          classroom? What works well / not well in school? What works well / not
          well in society? What works well / not well in the outside world?
        </em>{" "}
        While the students all worked within the meme format, they employed a
        large variety of art forms such as dance, film, performance, painting,
        drawing, sculpture, collage, and installation. The project concluded
        with an exhibition at Galleri Entrance Akademin Valand and a digital
        opening of <i>Memes from Kålltorpsskolan year 8</i>.
      </p>

        In empowering students to express themselves and making artistic
        production accessible through the format of memes, the project serves to
        break the invisible boundaries between contemporary art and everyday
        life. Furthermore, in democratising artistic expression, untold stories
        come to the surface: some are concerned with the mundane details of life
        and some are profound, but all are woven together into the tapestry of
        human experience. Embedded in this democratising endeavour is a layer of
        institutional critique: To whom does the domain of “contemporary art”
        belong? Who has the privilege of speaking and being taken seriously?
        And, as a society, how much value do we put on the voices of children?
