      <p>
        <i>Principles of harmony and contrast</i> is a series of 8 paintings on
        canvas displayed as flags. The flags visualise a new understanding of
        the political relations and conflicts of the contemporary world. On
        these flags, instead of recognisable heraldry and symbols, of primary
        colours, or even of shades of black and white, we see gradients of
        contrasting colours in delicate balance with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly in the contemporary world we have seen the emergence of
        social, political, and military groups across the globe which were first
        understood as opposing each other, but have since proven to inform,
        influence, and even depend on each other for their continued existence.
        While this mutual influence may be obscured in certain cases, it is
        nonetheless present.
      </p>
      <p>
        The paintings are the result of research undertaken by Zaghi into the
        contrasting relations between complementary colours, which are the
        symbolic ground on which she explores the influence opposites have on
        each other, and the mutual dependency and balance which develops between
        opposite points of the spectrum.
