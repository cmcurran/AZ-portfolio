        <i>Lullaby for a second generation immigrant</i> is an interdisciplinary
        project which includes a variety of media: clay sculptures and drawings,
        a video performance, and finally a mural.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project explores the problematics around immigration as a thing to
        be <em>inherited</em>, since second generation immigrants inherit this
        status from their parents. To be designated as a second, third, or even
        fourth generation immigrant is to be considered a foreigner in your own
        home – it’s to forever be cast as the <em>Other</em>. Is it ethical to
        intentionally bring a second generation immigrant into the world? Is it
        fair to inherit your parents’ migration? What is really being inherited?
        Is there a choice in all of this?

        Zaghi began processing these questions through a series of porcelain and
        clay sculptures of embryos. The process itself carries a symbolic
        weight: the clay must be fired in extremely high temperatures in order
        to harden. Zaghi then moved to drawing, producing over 50 drawings of
        embryos in different stages of development. One of these drawings became
        the poster for the theatre production{" "}
        <i>Vi Som Ärvde (We Who Inherited)</i> by Angereds Teater in
        collaboration with Göteborgs Stadsteater and Backa Teater.

        The video performance was produced in 2013 and presented in Göteborgs
        Konsthall in 2015. In the performance Zaghi is first seen cutting open
        the collar of her t-shirt using a scalpel; the blade is dangerously
        close to her throat and the risk of deadly injury is real. She then
        draws an embryo on her exposed neck while singing a lullaby in Persian.
        Finally, she sews the t-shirt back together, again with the risk of
        puncturing her throat. The danger inherent in pregnancy and childbirth,
        usually obscured, is displayed here with unflinching honesty and
        coloured with the pain of entrapment in an ethical quandary.

        The wall mural, painted in the city of Gothenburg in 2019, depicts a
        gestating embryo against a black background: here, the city is the
        mothering body. This mural is the result of a collaboration between
        Zaghi, the curator Ali Davoodi, and the real estate company Vasakronan.
