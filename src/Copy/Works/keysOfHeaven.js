        The over six hundred keys and keychains on display in{" "}
        <i>Keys of Heaven</i>
        have been collected (and continue to be collected) by Zaghi throughout
        her entire life. Coming from various people, they are vibrant
        expressions of stories, times, and places. Together they form a
        memorial: a memorial to people who owned them, but also to hopes and
        possibilities, to doors of all kinds that never opened or that have been
        closed once and for all.

        The title of the work refers to the image of crossed keys used in
        Catholic ecclesiastical heraldry, representing the metaphorical keys to
        the kingdom of Heaven, made in gold and silver to represent the powers
        of loosing and binding. Also referred to as <em>keys of the kingdom</em>
        , they are symbols of absolute papal and church authority – entry into
        heaven is an issue of <em>power</em> and <em>control</em>.
      </p>

        <i>Keys of Heaven</i> carries within it countless hidden stories –
        personal stories that reveal the political. Some stories are of
        migration, others of war, others of hope – and others yet touch on
        questions of human rights, of bodily autonomy, of identity, of freedom,
        of politics. The installation is accompanied by a workshop, in which
        participants are invited to make their own keychain as an object
        carrying a story.

        One of the keys comes from a woman who, as a girl, lived in the south of
        Iran during the war between Iran and Iraq. She used to carry the key to
        her home around her neck like a necklace, so that she would not risk
        losing it. One day she came home from school, however, to find that her
        home no longer existed – it was lost in a bombing.

      <p>
        Yet another story comes from a woman who, on visiting the first
        exhibition of the <i>Keys of Heaven</i> at Skånes Konstförening in 2019,
        decided in that moment to remove her keychain from her keys and donate
        it to the collection. The keychain commemorated the inauguration of the
        Oresund bridge on July 1st, 2000. This bridge connects Sweden with
        Denmark and the rest of continental Europe, and thus was a symbol of
        Nordic cooperation, of cross-border relationships, of openness and
        freedom of movement. On the day of the inauguration, this woman recalls,
        people were running between the two countries in celebration. In
        December 2015, however, due to the refugee crisis, the Swedish
        government installed border control officers, turning away individuals
        who lacked the correct citizen status. The Oresund bridge now became a
        border – a closed door.
