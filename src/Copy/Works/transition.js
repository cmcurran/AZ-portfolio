        <i>Transition</i> is a collaborative project whose aim was to expand the
        audience of contemporary art events in Gothenburg by reaching out
        specifically to those most marginalised by the art world. Striving to
        make art more accessible and break down divides, the project consisted
        of two parts: a hands-on photo workshop and a series of organised
        exhibition tours of the homonymous MFA degree exhibition at Göteborgs
        Konsthall. The project was organised on behalf of participants from
        Valand Academy and in partnership with organisations such as SFI groups,
        Intégrations Nätverket, Folksuniversitet, Göteborgs Konsthall,
        Lillhagsparken and the Red Cross.
      </p>
      <p>
        The participants of the project were invited directly at{" "}
        <i>Intégrations Nätverket</i> and Lillhagsparken 15 (the Red Cross
        asylum seekers camp in Gothenburg) to attend the planned tours and
        workshops.
      </p>

        The photo workshop included 25 participants who became familiar and
        friendly with each other during the course of the project. With the
        purpose of engendering creativity, confidence and connection to the
        city, the participants were given disposable cameras, and were Invited
        to explore the running theme of <i>Transition</i> as they saw fit. Their
        photographs, taken in various locations in Gothenburg, express life,
        death, hope, home, war and peace, conflicts, exile, political relations,
        belonging, personal and collective stories, and the unity of histories.
        The aim here was to provide the conditions within which the participants
        could share their own stories, individually and collectively, rather
        than attempt to speak on their behalf. The photographs were then shown
        in a self-organised exhibition at Lillhagsparken.
      </p>
      <p>
        The public tours of the <i>Transition</i> exhibition at Göteborgs
        Konsthall were offered in Swedish, Easy Swedish, English, Persian and
        Arabic. In this phase 50 people participated, with the duration of each
        tour being two hours. The tours proved incredibly successful and became
        a regular occurrence at Göteborgs Konsthall over the following years.
        This success illustrated that language and perceived differences in
        culture form large barriers against engagement with contemporary art –
        but once these barriers are taken down, it is apparent that people do in
        fact have the background necessary to understand contemporary art, for
        the simple fact that they live the political issues art is talking
        about.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within this project, pedagogy is political praxis: more than raising
        consciousness or even starting a conversation, it serves to break
        barriers and occupy spaces which are exclusionary.
