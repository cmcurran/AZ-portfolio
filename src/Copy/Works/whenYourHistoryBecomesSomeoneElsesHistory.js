        <i>When your history becomes someone else’s history</i> is a documentary
        film about a Iranian man who has created a museum to the city of Borås
        (a Swedish city of about 66.000 inhabitants) in the cellar of his house
        in Tehran.

        Having been a student at the University of Borås for two years, the
        film’s protagonist began collecting objects to commemorate his time
        there. His collection contains more than 150 objects, and includes,
        among other things, coins, dolls, books, plates, and tourist souvenirs.
        All these items, neatly arranged on his shelves, form a secret museum of
        the small Swedish city within the sprawling metropolis of Tehran. The
        film was made after Zaghi, by chance and to her great surprise, was
        presented the collection during a visit to Iran.

        Through the story of this museum, the film explores issues of cultural
        heritage and memory. While the collection itself carries a sense of
        whimsy, it inadvertently exposes fundamental problems in the practice of
        archiving and the construction of national cultural narratives. The
        objects on display are divorced from their original intended
        functionality and meaning – which are now almost irrelevant. They are,
        instead, imbued with a sense of history by their curator. This is, at
        their core, how museums function: narratives of national heritage and
        history are <em>made</em> through their curation and display, and
        histories can be altered, or even change owners.
      </p>
      <p>
        The museum to Borås is highly personal – it is a man’s attempt to keep
        his own beautiful memories alive. But the personal is political; and as
        it often happens, in the telling of a personal story, larger political,
        social, and historical issues are revealed.
