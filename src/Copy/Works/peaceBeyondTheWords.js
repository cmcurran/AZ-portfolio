    <>
      <p>
        <i>Peace Beyond the Words</i> is a collaborative pedagogical art
        project, continuing and extending the work of the 2019 painting series{" "}
        <i>Principles of Harmony and Contrast</i>. Through a series of workshops
        on vexillology (the study and design of flags), participants were
        invited to design their own flags, expressing their own stories,
        concerns, and values, beyond those imposed on them by their nation –
        avoiding the use of any existing national symbols entirely. The aim of
        the project was to facilitate generative discussions on the complexities
        of our collective and individual human experiences, complexities which
        are steamrolled by the narratives and interests of the <em>nation</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, the project includes 260 flags created during several
        workshop sessions by a large variety of participants. The flags of{" "}
        <i>Peace Beyond the Words</i> explore issues surrounding the
        environment, race, poverty, class, human rights, animal rights, war,
        migration, relationships, and more. Furthermore, the process of
        workshopping the designs itself explored the learned attachment people
        develop to their nation's flag: children, for example, were
        overwhelmingly eager to experiment with abstract painting or create
        illustrative drawings for their designs, whereas adults often tended to
        be rather protective, defensive even, of their national flag.
      </p>
      <p>
        These flag designs were collected by Zaghi and presented as a sculptural
        installation which has been exhibited in various public spaces. The
        flags are printed on cardboard and arranged so that they hold each other
        up: they’re interconnected and interdependent. On the reverse side, they
        display one of five gradations of gray, representing the nuances between
        black and white which we as humans inhabit. The sculptural installation
        presents a monument, assembled by the geographically and temporally
        dispersed participants, imagining new forms of community beyond
        boundaries and borders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Participants in the project include adults and children who live in
        Sweden’s largest asylum residence, Restad Gård in Vänersborg in
        collaboration with the Support Group Network, as well as adults and
        children from Lövgärdesskolan and Blå Stället (both in Angered,
        Gothenburg), Allas Ateljé and Kulturstråket Navet (both in Bergsjön,
        Gothenburg), Vasakronan ArtMadeThis, students of the University of
        Tehran, Iran, and finally, communities and individuals from around the
        world which joined the online workshops and shared their own flags
        through social media.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project was realised through a grant from Projektstöd Pronto,
        Kulturrådet (Swedish Arts Council), Sweden’s Västra Götalandsregionen,
        and through Konstepidemin’s open educational project space Allas Ateljé
        in Bergsjön, Gothenburg.
