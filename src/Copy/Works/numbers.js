        “We read about lives lost and are often given the numbers, but these
        stories are repeated every day, and the repetition appears endless,
        irremediable” begins Judith Butler in writing about Precariousness and
        Grievability in her book Frames of War: When Is Life Grievable?. “And
        so, we have to ask, what would it take not only to apprehend the
        precarious character of lives lost in war, but to have that apprehension
        coincide with an ethical and political opposition to the losses war
        entails?”

        Numbers normalise. They normalise violence, they normalise death.
        Numbers obscure the very humanity of those who are dead or injured.
        Numbers are necropolitical tools. Necropolitics, a term coined by
        Achille Mbembe, is described as more than the power to kill (Foucault's
        droit de glaive), but also the power to expose other people (including a
        country's own citizens) to death, and as the power to decide which lives
        are less-than-human and therefore less-than-alive – and thus, acceptable
        losses. In becoming numbers, the dead are separated from their humanity,
        they are made abstract.

        Violence is invisibly entangled with the politics of our everyday lives.
        In this project, Zaghi explores the subject of violence as seen through
        numbers and statistics through monumental paintings, installations, and
        performance.

        In this project, the abstracted numbers of the dead are given physical
        presence. In these monumental paintings, each life lost is distinctly
        and individually marked. The marks are dispersed within the frame, as if
        scattered with violent force. Each mark is small, but the sheer number
        of them is overwhelming – the paintings have no choice but to be
        monumental in scale, because the losses they are illustrating are
        themselves monumental in scale.

        The process of painting is in itself part of the work, as it is
        incredibly time-intensive. The paintings unfold over time and space
        seemingly endlessly; and, in fact, they cannot finish until the
        tragedies they are recording have ended. In these works, Zaghi is
        turning the power of numbers against those who use them to obscure the
        devastation at hand, and casts light on th catastrophe.

        The Syrian civil war which started a decade ago following the Arab
        Spring has claimed over 400.000 lives as of the time of writing. A
        further 100.000 have disappeared, and more than 13 million have left
        their homes. The circles rendering the lost lives are equal in size and
        of the same colour, representing the treatment of the dead in Western
        media: no death is given special significance. They are all reduced to
        simple numbers, their humanity robbed from them in death. While the
        humanity of those killed might be obscured, the scale of the killing
        cannot. These paintings illustrate this nearly incomprehensible scale:
        with each 1 x 2 metre painting containing 2.000 dots, it will take a
        staggering 200 paintings to depict all 400.000 deaths.

        <b>Numbers – Covid</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        At the time of writing (November 2021), 15.082 have already died in the
        Covid-19 pandemic in Sweden. Here the marks denoting deaths are not
        uniform dots, but rather spirals of varying sizes. The outwards spirals
        are symbols of life as a process of physical, mental and spiritual
        development; as something deeply human. Here, the lives lost are indeed
        seen as lives lost – as once living people who are no longer with us. In
        Western media, the deaths of those living in the West simply matter
        more, as those lives are seen as having had more value. The pandemic,
        after all, was only taken seriously when it started affecting Western
        countries. Still, some spirals are smaller than others, showing that
        even within the West, some are given more value than others.
