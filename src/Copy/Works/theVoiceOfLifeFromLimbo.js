        <i>The Voice of Life from Limbo</i> is an ongoing socially engaged
        pedagogical art project and future online exhibition platform,
        presenting memes created by unaccompanied children who live in Sweden’s
        largest asylum residence, Restad Gård in Vänersborg.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim of the project is to facilitate an environment where the
        children can speak and create freely. While their voices are often
        pushed to the margins, what emerges here are mature concerns over issues
        such as human rights, migration, democracy, censorship, colonialism, as
        well as various aspects of social, economic, and political inequalities
        and injustices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Memes are an expressive format which is widely and freely accessible to
        everyone, regardless of their background or education – even if they
        might be considered “not art” and are thus devalued. The use of memes
        here is not only a matter of opening an avenue of creative expression,
        but also contains the implicit questions:{" "}
        <em>
          Who is allowed to publicly speak and be heard? Who is pushed to the
          margins and why?
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the project is designed to use contemporary artistic
        practice as the vehicle with which to strengthen technical skills, and
        encourage civic engagement for the children living in limbo awaiting a
        decision from the Swedish Migration Board.

        Network), with the assistance of a grant from Västra Götalandsregionen.
