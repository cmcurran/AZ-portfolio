        <i>A monument of the city to build</i> is an ongoing long-term
        pedagogical and socially-engaged project realised in collaboration with
        artist Reyhaneh Mirjahani. The purpose of the project is to present the
        concepts of the
        <em>right to the city</em>, the right to public space, residentship, and
        responsibility to the children and young adults of Gothenburg through a
        series of pedagogical workshops and events.
      </p>
      <p>
        Placing an emphasis on intercultural meetings, the project aims to
        engage culturally diverse groups of children and young adults in the
        ongoing discussion on the right to the city, to empower them, and to
        help them see themselves as capable of demanding a better environment to
        live in. The participants engage in critical discussion in which they
        are encouraged to share their stories and to reflect on their lived
        experience in the city, while translating this conversation into a
        collaborative artwork. Manipulating photographs of Gothenburg collected
        via Google Maps, the participants create their own images and proposals
        of the city they want Gothenburg to become – creating a monument to the
        future instead of the past. In parallel, the project is mapping the
        public perception of the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project draws from a number of theoretical sources, such as the
        works Henri Lefebvre, Mark Purcell, and David Harvey to synthesise a
        comprehensive and multifaceted understanding of the right to the city.
        This understanding forms the basis of the workshops and informs the
        participants’ discussions. Challenging the neoliberal paradigm, urban
        space is approached as common space shaped by collective action, rather
        than the domain of isolated individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The right to the city is a topic that is increasingly popular in public
        discourse and has become a core issue among activists, academics, and
        politicians across the globe. Additionally, the right to the city is
        fundamentally intertwined with the struggle for democracy in the urban
        public sphere. However, young adults and children, as current and future
        residents of cities, are often left out of these conversations;
        particularly those who come from marginalised groups. In opening up the
        discussion, Zaghi and Mirjahani attempt to reorient decision-making
        power away from large institutions, from state and capital, and into the
        hands of the city’s inhabitants. Through the conversation about the
        right to the city, they create a space in which children and young
        adults can train in participation, responsibility, and critical
        thinking: the fundamental skills of active democratic citizens.
