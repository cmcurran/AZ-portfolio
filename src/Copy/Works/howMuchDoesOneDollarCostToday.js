        <i>How much does one dollar cost today?</i> is the shared title of three
        parts of this artistic research project, consisting of installation,
        video, and performance.

      <p>
        Following the Iranian Islamic revolution of 1979, Iranians have
        experienced various types of sanctions, divestment and boycotts which,
        over the years of the post-revolution era and during the eight-year war
        with Iraq, have seriously impacted Iran's economy. In 1980 the
        relationship between Iran and the US deteriorated as a group of students
        detained 52 American diplomats who were held hostage for 444 days in the
        American embassy in Tehran. This crisis broke down the political
        relationship between the two countries. The US initiated a series of
        sanctions against Iran in order to release the American hostages
        nonetheless. The impact of the miscommunication and non-democratic
        dialogue between the leaderships of both sides is not of comparable
        degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        “How much does one dollar cost today?” is an everyday question for
        Iranians, as their social and economic conditions change with the worth
        of the dollar. In 1979 the dollar was worth 71 Iranian Rial. Now, 42
        years after the revolution, it is worth 36775.50. While the immaterial
        market and economy are able to traverse territories and move freely,
        Iranians face the impact of the limits imposed by divestment such as
        visa restrictions. The latest series of sanctions by the United Nations
        Security Council (UNSC) on the Islamic Republic of Iran has affected
        Iranians politically, socially and economically in a multi-faceted
        manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project explores the possibility of peaceful negotiation and
        communication, as well as of a relationship that could resolve the
        confusion between both sides with earnest dialogue, all the while
        decreasing the impact of sanctions on the daily lives of Iranians. Zaghi
        addresses various aspects of the event through the language of inquiry
        to visualize the dynamic of the relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly, the project examines how actions such as sanctions and
        boycotts, which are considered “non-violent” political actions, become
        violent struggles through their impact on not only governments, but also
        on citizens living in precarity. Precarity is a term used by author Mark
        Fisher in his essay Time Wars and it “describes the situation where the
        formerly stable fixtures of life - work, home life, and the time
        available to dedicate to such things equally - become more fractured and
        unstable, leading to an existentially precarious and exhausting way of
        life.”
      </p>
      <p>
        For this project Zaghi collaborated closely with Dr. Nahid Kalbasi
        Anaraki. Aranaki earned a PhD in economics from George Mason University
        in 2003 with majors in international finance and monetary policy. Before
        moving to the US she worked as advisor to the director of the Central
        Bank of Iran. Currently she is an adjunct professor at Northcentral
        University, where she teaches business research and Macroeconomics.

        <b>Bread, How much does one dollar cost today?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Bread, or <i>nan</i> in Persian, is the cheapest as well as most
        important food item in Iranian diets. Politics and bread are closely
        linked in Iran (and not only). Supplying cheap bread has been a key
        principle of government policy in the past decades to ensure social
        stability.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the project Zaghi baked 20 kilos of flour into Iranian <i>nan</i>,
        from which she then cut 4,650 bread coins. This number is the current
        cost of bread, which has been inflated 464 percent since 1979. A scale
        was made out of chain and metal wire, examining the imbalance and lack
        of proportion between the two corresponding sides: one is holding a pile
        of bread with 4,650 holes cut out of it, and the other holds 4,650 bread
        coins.

        <b>Gold, How much does one dollar cost today?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        This video documents the process of melting two Iranian gold coins
        together and transforming them into a razor sharp object. This object
        symbolizes the severity of the communication and economic negotiation
        between the US and Iran. In the process of transforming the coins into a
        razor, the coins are losing their original value. Each coin contains 4
        grams of 19 karat gold – the completed razor’s weight is 7.1 grams.

      <p>
        <b>The performance, How much does one dollar cost today?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        In this performance Zaghi places the gold razor between her lips and
        counts the increase of the price of the dollar: from 71 Iranian Rial per
        US Dollar in 1979, to 27,564 Iranian Rial per US Dollar now. This takes
        1 hour, 4 minutes and 16 seconds. The process involves pain, suffering
        and physical injury. While she can feel the taste of blood in her mouth,
        the outside world perceives only an inconvenience.
