        The decisions we make, large or small, have a lasting effect on the
        world.
      </p>

        This footage from the recycling site in Borås, taken in 2013, shows the
        garbage railcar which is meant to transport combustible waste for
        heating, but something is wrong. Having first visited the site in 2011,
        Zaghi was fascinated by the waste sorting process, and more specifically
        the way it was rendered ineffectual: as the black plastic bags meant to
        contain combustible waste were torn during transportation, they spilled
        out their contents, revealing an assortment of random garbage. The
        refuse had been disposed of incorrectly from the start.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that moment, the action of throwing waste in a recycling bin seemed
        very much like the action of casting a vote in a ballot box. The
        decision is made privately, behind the closed door of a home or the
        curtain of a voting booth, and it is made all too often in a careless
        manner – but these decisions have consequences that reverberate into the
        future. Human decisions do not simply fade away.
      </p>

        In the few short years since the footage was taken, we have witnessed
        the rise of the far-right and the election of fascist demagogues into
        power. We have come close to seeing the most profoundly traumatic
        history of the twentieth century repeat itself, a history we have yet to
        heal from; a series of choices we have yet to heal from. We are, at this
        very moment, teetering on the point of no return, facing the possibility
        of mass extinction. We need to make a choice.
      </p>

        The paradigm shift brought by the Covid-19 pandemic can potentially
        signify the beginning of a series of positive social reforms – or it can
        escalate into a new age of authoritarian oppression across the globe. We
        must cast our vote in the ballot box.
