        This work explores the issue of children’s rights and the supposed
        guarantee of children’s safety in a world of increasing violence.

        Sparked by a poster on her daughter’s bedroom wall reading “Born to be
        Wild”, Zaghi began to question whether all children are equally allowed
        to be wild – wild, happy, free and safe, as children are meant to be.
        Thinking back to her own childhood which coincided in great part with
        the 8 year war between Iran and Iraq; and more recently to the image of
        three-year-old Alan Shenu lying dead on a Mediterranean beach; and even
        more recently to the footage of small children being thrown over barbed
        wire fences into the hands of American soldiers (and hopefully, to
        safety) in Afghanistan; she concluded that that is not the case.

        The images mentioned have been captured and spread world-wide through
        news and social media, becoming reference points of the cruelty of our
        times. But what about the images, the stories that are not photographed?
        The countless stories that are not “verified”?

        The Gothenburg-based artist Behjat Omer Abdulla references a story told
        in Swedish refugee camps in his 2016 work From a Distance. As the story
        is quite powerful, it is quoted here without changes:
        <blockquote>
          <em>
            Under the fear of war, as thousands of families fled their
            homelands, a mother of twin infants started her journey to seek a
            safer place. [...] During the harsh physical struggle of the
            journey, the mother lost one of her twin infants. Despite the loss,
            she kept the dead child with her for days on the boat. As tensions
            rose, the smugglers tried to force the mother to throw the body of
            her child into the sea. She refused and kept the body with her. One
            night, while the mother was sleeping, the smugglers took action. The
            mother woke to realize that her living child was missing and that
            she had been left with the dead child. The smugglers had mistakenly
            thrown the sleeping twin into the sea.
          </em>
        </blockquote>
        This account of a tragedy is told and retold in Swedish refugee camps,
        becoming a kind of myth, according to Abdulla. This is but one of many
        stories, many narratives, that are evidence of a collective attempt to
        comprehend the enormous scale of the tragedy unfolding in the world at
        this very moment. The tragedy of this nameless woman goes beyond her
        personal experience; it is a symbol of the devastation experienced by a
        whopping 26,4 million refugees and a further 65 million displaced people
        globally.

        Living in World War III is a work processing personal trauma, but it is
        also a work meant to sound the alarm on an international problem. The
        pervasiveness of violence and war in the world around us signifies that
        we are, indeed, living in World War III – but no-one is defining it as
        such, as those of us living in the West, those who have claimed power
        over history, have the privilege of living in the safe zones of this
        war.

        The crib in this installation dates to the interwar period, and belonged
        to the grandmother of a friend. The dolls have been gathered from a
        variety of sources, coming from different places, different times, and
        different people, but all of them are second-hand: all of them have once
        existed in the hand of a child. In laying there, amputated, they stand
        in for all the childhoods that were cut short.
