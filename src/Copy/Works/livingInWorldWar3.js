        This work explores the issue of children’s rights and the supposed
        guarantee of children’s safety in a world of increasing violence.
        Sparked by a poster on her daughter’s bedroom wall reading “Born to be
        Wild”, Zaghi began to question whether all children are equally allowed
        to be wild – wild, happy, free and safe, as children are meant to be.
      </p>

      <p>
        This poster had been specifically chosen by Zaghi as a hopeful message
        for her daughter, and was hung in a blue frame, her daughter’s favourite
        colour. Some time later, the young girl came up to her with a hand drawn
        copy of the poster, asking her what the message meant – she could read
        the words, but their meaning was unclear. Zaghi responded with “It means
        I want you to have a happy, safe, and free life; this is why I bought
        this poster for you”.
      </p>

        But her own response begged the question: while of course she wishes
        this life for her daughter, but what about the other children around the
        world? Are they allowed to be wild, safe, and happy? Thinking back to
        her own childhood which coincided in great part with the 8 year war
        between Iran and Iraq; and more recently to the image of three-year-old
        Alan Shenu lying dead on a Mediterranean beach; and even more recently
        to the footage of small children being thrown over barbed wire fences
        into the hands of American soldiers (and hopefully, to safety) in
        Afghanistan; she concluded that that is not the case.

        The stories mentioned have been captured in photo and video, spread
        world-wide through news and social media, becoming reference points of
        the cruelty of our times. But what about the images, the stories that
        are not photographed? The countless stories that are not “verified”?
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Living in World War III</i> is a work processing personal trauma, but
        it is also a work meant to sound the alarm on an international problem.
        The pervasiveness of violence and war in the world around us signifies
        that we are, indeed, living in World War III – but no-one is defining it
        as such, as those of us living in the West, those who have claimed power
        over history, have the privilege of living in the safe zones of this
        war.

        The hand drawn copy of the phrase “Born to be Wild” Azadeh’s daughter
        made, is transformed into a blue neon sign, her favourite colour. The
        crib in this installation dates to the interwar period, and belonged to
        the grandmother of a friend. The dolls have been gathered from a variety
        of sources, coming from different places, different times, and different
        people, but all of them are second-hand: all of them have once existed
        in the hand of a child. In laying there, amputated, they stand in for
        all the childhoods that were cut short.
