        <i>Untrustable Blue</i> is based on research Zaghi began in 2015, in
        which she gathered 180 images of politicians from around the world
        during public speeches. The speeches were all meant for a domestic
        public, meaning that they were speeches in which the politicians in
        question were not only meant to project authority and give the
        appearance of control, but also to make promises of prosperity. What
        stood out for Zaghi in this collection of images was the ubiquitous use
        of a certain shade of blue: in the background, in decorations, and even
        the clothes of the speakers.

        This shade of blue, as an element of the visual language of power,
        exposes not only the artifice with which those in government mask their
        tactics of control, but also what has been so aptly said by Marjane
        Satrapi:
      </p>
      <p>
        <blockquote>
          <em>
            The difference between you and your government is much bigger than
            the difference between you and me. And the difference between me and
            my government is much bigger than the difference between me and you.
            And our governments are very much the same.
          </em>
