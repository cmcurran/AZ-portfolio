        The installation of <i>Sacred ground</i> consists of 1300 razor blades
        forming a maze on a 4 x 4 metre foam mat; each razor blade has a
        national flag randomly displayed on its two sides. While this
        installation induces a sense of unease in and of itself, it is activated
        during a 30 minute performance in which Zaghi steps barefoot onto the
        mat, into the maze, and attempts to find her way out. Each slow, careful
        step heightens the anxiety of the audience as the artist is at constant
        risk of losing her balance and falling onto the blades, or
        miscalculating the width of a path and slicing her feet. The action is
        almost game-like, and the viewers expect this maze to conform to the
        rules of a game and have an exit path, a win-state; but there is no exit
        to the labyrinth. The performance does not end with success, but with
        exhaustion.

        The work explores the current social and political climate of the world
        in the age of both globalisation and increasing insularity. Governments,
        particularly those in the West, are investing millions in policing,
        guarding, and violently enforcing national borders. Focusing
        specifically on how borders affect and create radical nationalism,
        insularity, bewilderment and fear, this work aims to start a discussion
        on how much this adherence to national borders can damage a society and
        the individuals living in it. Ironically, the razors themselves have
        crossed borders at least twice: manufactured in China, they were bought
        by Zaghi in Iran before finally being brought to Sweden.

        The installation and performance are contrasted by a series of 26 black
        and white paintings. In these paintings the materiality of watercolour
        is used in order to explore freedom of movement, control of movement,
        restriction, borders and boundaries. The paintings are inspired by
        international maritime signal flags, which are used at sea for
        communication between ships, mostly imparting helpful information about
        the surrounding environment or requesting assistance. In being letters
        of an international language primarily concerned with safety, they have
        a peaceful appearance â€“ almost concealing the fact that the seas they
        fly over are graves for the bodies of unwanted refugees.
