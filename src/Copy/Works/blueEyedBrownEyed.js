        In the video performance <i>Blue eyed brown eyed</i> Zaghi is seen
        applying nine different pairs of contact lenses, one after the other,
        all different colours. The process is slow and visibly painful. The work
        explores questions of identity in relation to the body, constructions of
        race, and relationships of power.

        Zaghi’s simple act of applying coloured contact lenses to change the
        appearance of her eyes tells a complex story of{" "}
        <em>being-in-between</em> within a context in which there is a
        well-defined, "correct" way of being. Around the world, nationality and
        social status are tied to preconceptions of appearance: for example,
        Swedes are imagined as being blond, pale skinned, and blue eyed. The
        reality is, according to Jeff Werner in{" "}
        <i>Blond and Blue-eyed: Whiteness, Swedishness, and Visual Culture</i>,
        that this visual construction of <em>Swedishness</em> was most likely
        formed as late as the nineteenth century, in parallel with the creation
        of the modern Swedish nation-state. Similar artificial archetypes exist
        in nations across the globe, and are integral components in the
        vocabulary of nationalism. These artificial images have had and continue
        to have profound effects on the minds and bodies of millions. The
        contact lenses serve to expose the artifice of race signifiers –
        themselves originally manufactured in China and purchased by Zaghi in
        Iran, before finally crossing the borders to Sweden.

        The body, here, is the battleground on which borders, territories,
        limits are fought on. At the same time, the body is a tool for
        resistance. The body is the site on which history is inscribed and
        carried – in altering the body, the narration of history is altered as
        well. In changing the body, in unsettling and pushing it, Zaghi explores
        the potential for the mind to unsettle, push, pull, and finally break
        the mental and emotional restrictions imposed upon it due to skin
        colour, language, ethnicity, and religion. After all, “[p]erformance is
        one way in which the artistic and the political can and do come
        together” according to Judith Butler (2014). The space of performance is
        a space for freedom and political mobility, and political solidarity can
        form through art and culture. Artistic practice can be a bridge between
        people – it can break borders.

        <i>Blue eyed brown eyed</i> takes its title from the{" "}
        <i>Blue eyes/Brown eyes</i>
        classroom experiment and research done in the 1960s by Jane Elliott, the
        American anti-racism activist and educator.

        The work was purchased by the Swedish Arts Agency in 2021 and is
        currently in its collection.
