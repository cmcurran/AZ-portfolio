Moving beyond the labels of \u201cartist\u201d or \u201cpedagogue\u201d, she mindfully designs environments for collective art-making by carefully choosing the right topics, educational tools, and pedagogical forms, always with a deep understanding of the communities she works within."),Object(h.c)("p",null,"Through her projects, she works to tear down the boundaries between the contemporary art world and everyday life, and to democratise the tools of artistic expression. Facilitating intercultural encounters is immensely important to her work, as well as creating the space for those most marginalised in society to speak. Embedded in this endeavour is a layer of institutional critique, as she invites us to question: Who is allowed within the domain of contemporary art? Who is given the privilege of a public platform? And most importantly, who is excluded from these things and why?"),Object(h.c)("p",null,"As she herself states, her artistic collaborations have the potential to help the participating communities and increase familiarity with art, while also encouraging public dialogue and engagement with the political, social and economic issues that affect us in our everyday lives.

It could be said that the participatory action itself has equal or higher value than the production of the physical works of art. More than providing a mere representation of her collaborators\u2019 concerns, she enables them to tell their own stories, which she then weaves together into narrative tapestries."),Object(h.c)("p",null,"Personal narratives have particular importance throughout Zaghi\u2019s work, as it is through the personal that the political is revealed. Many of her projects reveal stories of migration, of borders, of conflict and war, of institutional power and its abuse \u2013 in other words, of history in the making. The stories she sheds light on, the stories she archives, challenge hegemonic narratives and widely accepted injustices. In every single one of her projects, Zaghi is dedicated to (as she says in her own words) \u201cbringing unheard-of and less-prominent events to the surface and highlighting them\u201d."))))};var Ce={name:"1c24e64",styles:"padding-top:2rem;padding-bottom:1rem;@media (min-width: 650px){padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0;}"},He=function(e){var t=e.copy;return Object(h.c)(M,null,Object(h.c)("div",{css:ze.left}),Object(h.c)("div",{css:ze.right},t.map((function(e,i){return e.work.map((function(e,n){return 0===n?Object(h.c)("div",{css:ze.row},Object(h.c)("span",{css:[ze.yearLabel,Ce,"",""]},t[i].year)," ",Object(h.c)(p.a,{to:e.path},e.title)):Object(h.c)("div",{css:ze.row},Object(h.c)("span",{css:ze.yearLabel})," ",Object(h.c)(p.a,{to:e.path},e.title))}))}))))},ze={left:{name:"1t29t6p",styles:"width:50%"},right:{name:"fvkvkx",styles:"display:flex;flex-direction:column;font-size:20px;padding:5rem 0;::last-child{padding-bottom:5rem;}@media (max-width: 900px){font-size:16px;}"},yearLabel:{name:"w76u8a",styles:"display:inline-block;@media (min-width: 650px){width:5rem;padding-left:1rem;}"},row:{name:"l6d8lx",styles:"padding-bottom:0.75rem;padding-left:0;@media (max-width: 650px){display:flex;flex-direction:column;padding-left:2rem;}"}},Ge=function(e){var t=e.children;return Object(h.c)(o.a.Fragment,null,t)};s.a.render(Object(h.c)((function(){var e=Object(a.useState)(),t=Object(n.a)(e,2),i=t[0],r=t[1];return Object(h.c)(o.a.StrictMode,null,Object(h.c)(m,null,Object(h.c)(p.b,{primary:!1,component:Ge},Object(h.c)(S,{path:"/",setNavHeight:r,navHeight:i},Object(h.c)(F,{path:"/"}),Object(h.c)(U,{path:"/about",navHeight:i}),Object(h.c)(Te,{path:"/contact"}),Object(h.c)(Se,{path:"/statement"}),Object(h.c)(He,{path:"projects",copy:se}),se.map((function(e){return e.work.map((function(e){return Object(h.c)(ye,{path:"projects/".concat(e.path),content:e.work,navHeight:i})}))}))))))}),null),document.getElementById("root"))}},[[50,1,2]]]);
