To be designated as a second, third, or even\n        fourth generation immigrant is to be considered a foreigner in your own\n        home – it’s to forever be cast as the <em>Other</em>. Is it ethical to\n        intentionally bring a second generation immigrant into the world? Is it\n        fair to inherit your parents’ migration? What is really being inherited?\n        Is there a choice in all of this?\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Zaghi began processing these questions through a series of porcelain and\n        clay sculptures of embryos. The process itself carries a symbolic\n        weight: the clay must be fired in extremely high temperatures in order\n        to harden. Zaghi then moved to drawing, producing over 50 drawings of\n        embryos in different stages of development. One of these drawings became\n        the poster for the theatre production{\" \"}\n        <i>Vi Som Ärvde (We Who Inherited)</i> by Angereds Teater in\n        collaboration with Göteborgs Stadsteater and Backa Teater.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The video performance was produced in 2013 and presented in Göteborgs\n        Konsthall in 2015. In the performance Zaghi is first seen cutting open\n        the collar of her t-shirt using a scalpel; the blade is dangerously\n        close to her throat and the risk of deadly injury is real. She then\n        draws an embryo on her exposed neck while singing a lullaby in Persian.\n        Finally, she sews the t-shirt back together, again with the risk of\n        puncturing her throat. The danger inherent in pregnancy and childbirth,\n        usually obscured, is displayed here with unflinching honesty and\n        coloured with the pain of entrapment in an ethical quandary.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The wall mural, painted in the city of Gothenburg in 2019, depicts a\n        gestating embryo against a black background: here, the city is the\n        mothering body.

The process is slow and visibly painful.

Around the world, nationality and\n        social status are tied to preconceptions of appearance: for example,\n        Swedes are imagined as being blond, pale skinned, and blue eyed. The\n        reality is, according to Jeff Werner in{\" \"}\n        <i>Blond and Blue-eyed: Whiteness, Swedishness, and Visual Culture</i>,\n        that this visual construction of <em>Swedishness</em> was most likely\n        formed as late as the nineteenth century, in parallel with the creation\n        of the modern Swedish nation-state. Similar artificial archetypes exist\n        in nations across the globe, and are integral components in the\n        vocabulary of nationalism. These artificial images have had and continue\n        to have profound effects on the minds and bodies of millions. The\n        contact lenses serve to expose the artifice of race signifiers –\n        themselves originally manufactured in China and purchased by Zaghi in\n        Iran, before finally crossing the borders to Sweden.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The body, here, is the battleground on which borders, territories,\n        limits are fought on. At the same time, the body is a tool for\n        resistance. The body is the site on which history is inscribed and\n        carried – in altering the body, the narration of history is altered as\n        well. In changing the body, in unsettling and pushing it, Zaghi explores\n        the potential for the mind to unsettle, push, pull, and finally break\n        the mental and emotional restrictions imposed upon it due to skin\n        colour, language, ethnicity, and religion. After all, “[p]erformance is\n        one way in which the artistic and the political can and do come\n        together” according to Judith Butler (2014).

In 1980 the\n        relationship between Iran and the US deteriorated as a group of students\n        detained 52 American diplomats who were held hostage for 444 days in the\n        American embassy in Tehran. This crisis broke down the political\n        relationship between the two countries. The US initiated a series of\n        sanctions against Iran in order to release the American hostages\n        nonetheless. The impact of the miscommunication and non-democratic\n        dialogue between the leaderships of both sides is not of comparable\n        degree.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        “How much does one dollar cost today?” is an everyday question for\n        Iranians, as their social and economic conditions change with the worth\n        of the dollar. In 1979 the dollar was worth 71 Iranian Rial. Now, 42\n        years after the revolution, it is worth 36775.50. While the immaterial\n        market and economy are able to traverse territories and move freely,\n        Iranians face the impact of the limits imposed by divestment such as\n        visa restrictions. The latest series of sanctions by the United Nations\n        Security Council (UNSC) on the Islamic Republic of Iran has affected\n        Iranians politically, socially and economically in a multi-faceted\n        manner.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The project explores the possibility of peaceful negotiation and\n        communication, as well as of a relationship that could resolve the\n        confusion between both sides with earnest dialogue, all the while\n        decreasing the impact of sanctions on the daily lives of Iranians. Zaghi\n        addresses various aspects of the event through the language of inquiry\n        to visualize the dynamic of the relationship.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Most importantly, the project examines how actions such as sanctions and\n        boycotts, which are considered “non-violent” political actions, become\n        violent struggles through their impact on not only governments, but also\n        on citizens living in precarity. Precarity is a term used by author Mark\n        Fisher in his essay Time Wars and it “describes the situation where the\n        formerly stable fixtures of life - work, home life, and the time\n        available to dedicate to such things equally - become more fractured and\n        unstable, leading to an existentially precarious and exhausting way of\n        life.”\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        For this project Zaghi collaborated closely with Dr. Nahid Kalbasi\n        Anaraki. Aranaki earned a PhD in economics from George Mason University\n        in 2003 with majors in international finance and monetary policy. Before\n        moving to the US she worked as advisor to the director of the Central\n        Bank of Iran. Currently she is an adjunct professor at Northcentral\n        University, where she teaches business research and Macroeconomics.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <b>Bread, How much does one dollar cost today?</b>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Bread, or <i>nan</i> in Persian, is the cheapest as well as most\n        important food item in Iranian diets.

A scale\n        was made out of chain and metal wire, examining the imbalance and lack\n        of proportion between the two corresponding sides: one is holding a pile\n        of bread with 4,650 holes cut out of it, and the other holds 4,650 bread\n        coins.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <b>Gold, How much does one dollar cost today?</b>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This video documents the process of melting two Iranian gold coins\n        together and transforming them into a razor sharp object.

In the process of transforming the coins into a\n        razor, the coins are losing their original value. Each coin contains 4\n        grams of 19 karat gold – the completed razor’s weight is 7.1 grams.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <b>The performance, How much does one dollar cost today?</b>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In this performance Zaghi places the gold razor between her lips and\n        counts the increase of the price of the dollar: from 71 Iranian Rial per\n        US Dollar in 1979, to 27,564 Iranian Rial per US Dollar now.

Focusing\n        specifically on how borders affect and create radical nationalism,\n        insularity, bewilderment and fear, this work aims to start a discussion\n        on how much this adherence to national borders can damage a society and\n        the individuals living in it. Ironically, the razors themselves have\n        crossed borders at least twice: manufactured in China, they were bought\n        by Zaghi in Iran before finally being brought to Sweden.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The installation and performance are contrasted by a series of 26 black\n        and white paintings. In these paintings the materiality of watercolour\n        is used in order to explore freedom of movement, control of movement,\n        restriction, borders and boundaries. The paintings are inspired by\n        international maritime signal flags, which are used at sea for\n        communication between ships, mostly imparting helpful information about\n        the surrounding environment or requesting assistance. In being letters\n        of an international language primarily concerned with safety, they have\n        a peaceful appearance – almost concealing the fact that the seas they\n        fly over are graves for the bodies of unwanted refugees.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  ),\n  gallery: [\n    {\n      img: \"sacredGround1.jpg\",\n      thumb: \"sacredGround1.jpg\",\n\n      dimensions: {\n        width: \"372\",\n        height: \"186\",\n      },\n    },\n\n    {\n      img: \"sacredGround2.jpg\",\n      thumb: \"sacredGround2.jpg\",\n\n      dimensions: {\n        width: \"480\",\n        height: \"360\",\n      },\n    },\n\n    {\n      img: \"sacredGround3.jpg\",\n      thumb: \"sacredGround3.jpg\",\n\n      dimensions: {\n        width: \"206\",\n        height: \"277\",\n      },\n    },\n\n    {\n      img: \"sacredGround4.jpg\",\n      thumb: \"sacredGround4.jpg\",\n\n      dimensions: {\n        width: \"589\",\n        height: \"294\",\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n};\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nexport const ifTheLordYourGodEnlargesYourTerritory = {\n  title: \"If the LORD your God enlarges your territory\",\n  date: \"2019\",\n  material: \"Fragments of glazed ceramic pottery, medical gauze, wooden box.\",\n  about: (\n    <>\n      <p>\n        <i>If the LORD your God enlarges your territory</i> investigates the\n        role archaeology plays in the construction of cultural heritage and\n        political identity, challenging its viewers to consider the influence\n        colonial and capitalist institutions play in the shaping of history,\n        territory, and contemporary politics.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Zaghi collected the ceramic fragments from the ground of Tepe Sialk, a\n        large archaeological site outside the city of Kashan in the Isfahan\n        Province of central Iran, during a research trip in 2001.

The purpose of the project is to present the\n        concepts of the\n        <em>right to the city</em>, the right to public space, residentship, and\n        responsibility to the children and young adults of Gothenburg through a\n        series of pedagogical workshops and events.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Placing an emphasis on intercultural meetings, the project aims to\n        engage culturally diverse groups of children and young adults in the\n        ongoing discussion on the right to the city, to empower them, and to\n        help them see themselves as capable of demanding a better environment to\n        live in. The participants engage in critical discussion in which they\n        are encouraged to share their stories and to reflect on their lived\n        experience in the city, while translating this conversation into a\n        collaborative artwork.

However, young adults and children, as current and future\n        residents of cities, are often left out of these conversations;\n        particularly those who come from marginalised groups.

Through a series of workshops\n        on vexillology (the study and design of flags), participants were\n        invited to design their own flags, expressing their own stories,\n        concerns, and values, beyond those imposed on them by their nation –\n        avoiding the use of any existing national symbols entirely. The aim of\n        the project was to facilitate generative discussions on the complexities\n        of our collective and individual human experiences, complexities which\n        are steamrolled by the narratives and interests of the <em>nation</em>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        At this point, the project includes 260 flags created during several\n        workshop sessions by a large variety of participants.

Furthermore, the process of\n        workshopping the designs itself explored the learned attachment people\n        develop to their nation's flag: children, for example, were\n        overwhelmingly eager to experiment with abstract painting or create\n        illustrative drawings for their designs, whereas adults often tended to\n        be rather protective, defensive even, of their national flag.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        These flag designs were collected by Zaghi and presented as a sculptural\n        installation which has been exhibited in various public spaces. The\n        flags are printed on cardboard and arranged so that they hold each other\n        up: they’re interconnected and interdependent. On the reverse side, they\n        display one of five gradations of gray, representing the nuances between\n        black and white which we as humans inhabit.

Having first visited the site in 2011,\n        Zaghi was fascinated by the waste sorting process, and more specifically\n        the way it was rendered ineffectual: as the black plastic bags meant to\n        contain combustible waste were torn during transportation, they spilled\n        out their contents, revealing an assortment of random garbage.

They normalise violence, they normalise death.\n        Numbers obscure the very humanity of those who are dead or injured.\n        Numbers are necropolitical tools. Necropolitics, a term coined by\n        Achille Mbembe, is described as more than the power to kill (Foucault's\n        droit de glaive), but also the power to expose other people (including a\n        country's own citizens) to death, and as the power to decide which lives\n        are less-than-human and therefore less-than-alive – and thus, acceptable\n        losses. In becoming numbers, the dead are separated from their humanity,\n        they are made abstract.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Violence is invisibly entangled with the politics of our everyday lives.\n        In this project, Zaghi explores the subject of violence as seen through\n        numbers and statistics through monumental paintings, installations, and\n        performance.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In this project, the abstracted numbers of the dead are given physical\n        presence. In these monumental paintings, each life lost is distinctly\n        and individually marked. The marks are dispersed within the frame, as if\n        scattered with violent force. Each mark is small, but the sheer number\n        of them is overwhelming – the paintings have no choice but to be\n        monumental in scale, because the losses they are illustrating are\n        themselves monumental in scale.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The process of painting is in itself part of the work, as it is\n        incredibly time-intensive. The paintings unfold over time and space\n        seemingly endlessly; and, in fact, they cannot finish until the\n        tragedies they are recording have ended. In these works, Zaghi is\n        turning the power of numbers against those who use them to obscure the\n        devastation at hand, and casts light on th catastrophe.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The Syrian civil war which started a decade ago following the Arab\n        Spring has claimed over 400.000 lives as of the time of writing. A\n        further 100.000 have disappeared, and more than 13 million have left\n        their homes. The circles rendering the lost lives are equal in size and\n        of the same colour, representing the treatment of the dead in Western\n        media: no death is given special significance. They are all reduced to\n        simple numbers, their humanity robbed from them in death. While the\n        humanity of those killed might be obscured, the scale of the killing\n        cannot. These paintings illustrate this nearly incomprehensible scale:\n        with each 1 x 2 metre painting containing 2.000 dots, it will take a\n        staggering 200 paintings to depict all 400.000 deaths.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <b>Numbers – Covid</b>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        At the time of writing (November 2021), 15.082 have already died in the\n        Covid-19 pandemic in Sweden.

The outwards spirals\n        are symbols of life as a process of physical, mental and spiritual\n        development; as something deeply human. Here, the lives lost are indeed\n        seen as lives lost – as once living people who are no longer with us. In\n        Western media, the deaths of those living in the West simply matter\n        more, as those lives are seen as having had more value. The pandemic,\n        after all, was only taken seriously when it started affecting Western\n        countries. Still, some spirals are smaller than others, showing that\n        even within the West, some are given more value than others.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  ),\n  gallery: [],\n};\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nexport const livingInWorldWar3 = {\n  title: \"Living in World War III\",\n  date: \"2021\",\n  material: \"Installation: cradle, dolls, neon sign.\",\n  about: (\n    <>\n      <p>\n        This work explores the issue of children’s rights and the supposed\n        guarantee of children’s safety in a world of increasing violence.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Sparked by a poster on her daughter’s bedroom wall reading “Born to be\n        Wild”, Zaghi began to question whether all children are equally allowed\n        to be wild – wild, happy, free and safe, as children are meant to be.\n        Thinking back to her own childhood which coincided in great part with\n        the 8 year war between Iran and Iraq; and more recently to the image of\n        three-year-old Alan Shenu lying dead on a Mediterranean beach; and even\n        more recently to the footage of small children being thrown over barbed\n        wire fences into the hands of American soldiers (and hopefully, to\n        safety) in Afghanistan; she concluded that that is not the case.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The images mentioned have been captured and spread world-wide through\n        news and social media, becoming reference points of the cruelty of our\n        times.

As the story\n        is quite powerful, it is quoted here without changes:\n        <blockquote>\n          <em>\n            Under the fear of war, as thousands of families fled their\n            homelands, a mother of twin infants started her journey to seek a\n            safer place. [...] During the harsh physical struggle of the\n            journey, the mother lost one of her twin infants. Despite the loss,\n            she kept the dead child with her for days on the boat. As tensions\n            rose, the smugglers tried to force the mother to throw the body of\n            her child into the sea. She refused and kept the body with her. One\n            night, while the mother was sleeping, the smugglers took action. The\n            mother woke to realize that her living child was missing and that\n            she had been left with the dead child. The smugglers had mistakenly\n            thrown the sleeping twin into the sea.\n          </em>\n        </blockquote>\n        This account of a tragedy is told and retold in Swedish refugee camps,\n        becoming a kind of myth, according to Abdulla. This is but one of many\n        stories, many narratives, that are evidence of a collective attempt to\n        comprehend the enormous scale of the tragedy unfolding in the world at\n        this very moment. The tragedy of this nameless woman goes beyond her\n        personal experience; it is a symbol of the devastation experienced by a\n        whopping 26,4 million refugees and a further 65 million displaced people\n        globally.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Living in World War III is a work processing personal trauma, but it is\n        also a work meant to sound the alarm on an international problem. The\n        pervasiveness of violence and war in the world around us signifies that\n        we are, indeed, living in World War III – but no-one is defining it as\n        such, as those of us living in the West, those who have claimed power\n        over history, have the privilege of living in the safe zones of this\n        war.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The crib in this installation dates to the interwar period, and belonged\n        to the grandmother of a friend. The dolls have been gathered from a\n        variety of sources, coming from different places, different times, and\n        different people, but all of them are second-hand: all of them have once\n        existed in the hand of a child. In laying there, amputated, they stand\n        in for all the childhoods that were cut short.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  ),\n  gallery: [],\n};\n","import { css } from \"@emotion/react\";\nimport styled from \"@emotion/styled\";\nimport React, { useRef, useState } from \"react\";\nimport { useIntersection } from \"../Hooks/useIntersectionObserver\";\n\nexport const ImageRenderer: React.FC<{\n  img: string;\n  thumb: string;\n  dimensions: { width: string; height: string };\n  onClick: () => void;\n}> = ({ img, thumb, dimensions, onClick }) => {\n  const [isInView, setIsInView] = useState<boolean>(false);\n  const [isLoaded, setIsLoaded] = useState<boolean>(false);\n  const imgRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);\n  useIntersection(imgRef, () => {\n    setIsInView(true);\n  });\n\n  const handleOnLoad = () => {\n    setIsLoaded(true);\n  };\n  return (\n    <ImgContainer\n      ref={imgRef}\n      width={Number(dimensions.width)}\n      height={Number(dimensions.height)}\n    >\n      {isInView && (\n        <>\n          <img\n            alt={thumb}\n            src={`/Images/${thumb}`}\n            css={[\n              styles.image,\n              styles.thumb,\n              !!isLoaded && styles.thumbIsLoaded,\n            ]}\n          />\n          <img\n            alt={img}\n            src={`/Images/${img}`}\n            css={[styles.image, !!isLoaded && styles.imgIsLoaded]}\n            onClick={onClick}\n            onLoad={handleOnLoad}\n          />\n        </>\n      )}\n    </ImgContainer>\n  );\n};\n\nconst styles = {\n  image: css`\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n    opacity: 0;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    -webkit-transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;\n    -moz-transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;\n    -o-transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;\n    transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;\n    display: inline-block;\n    position: absolute;\n\n    :hover {\n      transform: scale(1.05);\n      transition: transform 0.2s ease-out;\n    }\n  `,\n  thumb: css`\n    opacity: 1;\n    filter: blur(10px);\n    transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out;\n    position: absolute;\n  `,\n  thumbIsLoaded: css`\n    opacity: 0;\n  `,\n  imgIsLoaded: css`\n    transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out;\n    opacity: 1;\n  `,\n};\n\nconst ImgContainer = styled.div<{ width: number; height: number }>`\n  padding-bottom: ${({ width, height }) => `${(height / width) * 100}%`};\n\n  width: 100%;\n  max-width: 100%;\n  background-color: #eeeeee;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  position: relative;\n`;\n","import React, { useEffect, useState } from \"react\";\nimport { css, Theme } from \"@emotion/react\";\nimport { RouteComponentProps } from \"@reach/router\";\nimport { AppViewWrapper } from \"./AppViewWrapper\";\nimport Lightbox from \"react-image-lightbox\";\nimport debounce from \"lodash.debounce\";\nimport { ScrollDiv } from \"./Styled/ScrollDiv\";\nimport { ImageRenderer } from \"./ImageRenderer\";\n\nexport const Gallery: React.FC<\n  RouteComponentProps & {\n    navHeight: number | undefined;\n    content: GalleryContent;\n  }\n> = ({ content, navHeight }) => {\n  const [height, setHeight] = useState<number>();\n  const [photoIndex, setPhotoIndex] = useState<number>(0);\n\n  const [open, setOpen] = useState<boolean>(false);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!window) {\n      return;\n    }\n\n    if (!height) {\n      setHeight(window.innerHeight);\n    }\n\n    const resizeListener = () => {\n      setHeight(window.innerHeight);\n    };\n\n    const debounced = debounce(resizeListener, 100);\n    window.addEventListener(\"resize\", debounced);\n\n    return () => {\n      debounced.cancel();\n      window.removeEventListener(\"resize\", resizeListener);\n    };\n  }, [height, setHeight]);\n\n  const imageArray = content.gallery.map((item) => ({\n    img: `/Images/${item.img}`,\n    thumb: `/Images/${item.thumb}`,\n  }));\n\n  return navHeight && height ?

Zaghi’s work is centered on issues of heritage, nationalism,\n          representation, democracy, accessibility, pedagogy, and institutional\n          critique. Her expansive practice includes performance, video art,\n          installations, documentary filmmaking, social practice, and most\n          notably, participatory research-based pedagogical projects.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Zaghi’s expertise lies in her ability to create environments for open\n          discussion and creative expression in her projects. Moving beyond the\n          labels of “artist” or “pedagogue”, she mindfully designs environments\n          for collective art-making by carefully choosing the right topics,\n          educational tools, and pedagogical forms, always with a deep\n          understanding of the communities she works within.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Through her projects, she works to tear down the boundaries between\n          the contemporary art world and everyday life, and to democratise the\n          tools of artistic expression. Facilitating intercultural encounters is\n          immensely important to her work, as well as creating the space for\n          those most marginalised in society to speak. Embedded in this\n          endeavour is a layer of institutional critique, as she invites us to\n          question: Who is allowed within the domain of contemporary art? Who is\n          given the privilege of a public platform? And most importantly, who is\n          excluded from these things and why?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          As she herself states, her artistic collaborations have the potential\n          to help the participating communities and increase familiarity with\n          art, while also encouraging public dialogue and engagement with the\n          political, social and economic issues that affect us in our everyday\n          lives. Her participatory projects proudy display the power of\n          solidarity and cooperation.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In her practice, Zaghi shifts the focus away from herself as an artist\n          and onto the creative vision of the projects’ collaborators and\n          participants, enabling them to reflect, to act and to respond. It\n          could be said that the participatory action itself has equal or higher\n          value than the production of the physical works of art. More than\n          providing a mere representation of her collaborators’ concerns, she\n          enables them to tell their own stories, which she then weaves together\n          into narrative tapestries.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Personal narratives have particular importance throughout Zaghi’s\n          work, as it is through the personal that the political is revealed.\n          Many of her projects reveal stories of migration, of borders, of\n          conflict and war, of institutional power and its abuse – in other\n          words, of history in the making. The stories she sheds light on, the\n          stories she archives, challenge hegemonic narratives and widely\n          accepted injustices. In every single one of her projects, Zaghi is\n          dedicated to (as she says in her own words) “bringing unheard-of and\n          less-prominent events to the surface and highlighting them”.\n
